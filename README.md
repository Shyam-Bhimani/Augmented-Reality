# Augmented-Reality

This is the code for sample augmented book.

I take a help from mymultimediaworld.com to make this augmented book.

You can also create an account on mymultimediaworld and create augmented book without coding.

If you want to change according to your requirement then mymultimediaworld provide 'download Package' option. you got one compressed file in that one file with ".bt" extension. 

you do the changes in .bt file. you don't need to do whole coding.

Its too easy...
thanks a lot..
